[ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) is a framework for building administration pages for a Ruby on Rails website quickly. From the ActiveAdmin website:

> Active Admin is a Ruby on Rails plugin for generating administration style interfaces. It abstracts common business application patterns to make it simple for developers to implement beautiful and elegant interfaces with very little effort.

Why important
---

Many sites require an admin panel for administraion of the site.  Building this from scratch each time often doesn't make sense since most of the requiremens are for CRUD style features.
