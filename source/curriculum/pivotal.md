[Heroku](http://heroku.com/) is the most widely used hosting platform for Ruby on Rails solutions. From their website:

> Heroku (pronounced her-OH-koo) is a cloud application platform â€“ a new way of building and deploying web apps.

> Our service lets app developers spend their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling.

It is [free to sign up](https://id.heroku.com/signup), free to host a basic app, and you only "pay as you grow".

Why important
---

With Heroku, you spend more of your time writing application code, and less of your time configuring and supporting a server.  Heroku is **widely** used in the Rails community and is the fastest way for you to deploy your test applications to the cloud.

How we teach it
---

You will deploy to Heroku from day one. Like most things, you learn by doing.
