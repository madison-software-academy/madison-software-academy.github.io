Sublime Text
======

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is one of the most widely used text editors.  We think it is an excellent editor for beginning developers. From their website:

> Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.
> You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.

It is [free to evaluate](http://www.sublimetext.com) and well worth the low cost of purchase.

Why important
---

Because your text editor is your tool.  Developers spend the majority of their time **reading** code, so we advocate for a tool that helps you find and read code.  This is much more important than *writing*.

How we teach it
---

You will be reading code and editing files from day one.
